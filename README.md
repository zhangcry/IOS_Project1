## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had challenges connecting the data from one controller to the other. For some reason, the if statement in the prepare method in ViewController doesn't work (isn't passing anything through). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to communicate the data that way. I wrote all the code I thought I needed for it to work but I couldn't figure out the bug so the app is not dynamic. I will work on fixing this for future iterations. 
- I spent over two hours addressing the bug but eventually gave up.
